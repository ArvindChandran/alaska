This repo provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for steganalysis in the JPEG domain, trained and used to win the [ALASKA steganalaysis challenge](https://alaska.utt.fr/). Details about the architectures can be found in our [paper](http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/ALASKA-preprint1.pdf).


## Features

- Color seperated feature maps extraction using pretrained [SRNet](http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/Research/SRNet.pdf) models
- Arbitrary size steganalysis using pretrained detectors 
- Notebooks to fine-tune feature extractors and train custom detectors
- Models are shared within the Tensorflow framework, and converted to [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) for use with other deep learning frameworks.

Please note that shared models are only for JPEG quality factor 95. Please open an issue if other quality factors are needed.

## Dependecies

Python 3.5+ and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Getting started - Downloading models

Please run the following python code to download the available models.

```python
import requests
import zipfile
import os
home = os.path.expanduser("~")
user = home.split('/')[-1]

url = 'http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/alaska/models.zip'
local = home + '/alaska_github/models.zip'

r = requests.get(url)
with open(local, 'wb') as f:
    for chunk in tqdm(r.iter_content(chunk_size=2**10)): 
        if chunk:
            f.write(chunk)
with zipfile.ZipFile(local, 'r') as zipref:
    zipref.extractall(home + '/alaska_github/')
    
os.remove(local)
```

## Getting started - Downloading datasets

This repo comes with minimal image examples, the complete datasets are available [here](https://alaska.utt.fr/#material) (note that you need to create a free account)
